## PROJECT DETAILS[&uarr;](#student-developer-info-)
### [Augur](https://github.com/chaoss/augur):
Augur is a software suite for collecting and measuring structured data about free and open-source software (FOSS) communities. We do this by gathering data about project repositories and normalizing that into our data model to provide useful metrics about your projectâ€™s health. 

### [augur_view]():

### [augur-new](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/tree/augur-new):


## WORK [&uarr;](#project-details-)
### OBJECTIVES:

#### Primary
- Develop login functionalities so that admins and users can access augur. Populate the tables with information from the user.

- Connect the login to the augur_data.chaoss_user table instead of the sqllite3 database.

- Implement the endpoints necessary for account creation and authentication on the backend.

- Work on the CLI components for creating admin and user accounts.
#### Secondary
- Augur enpoints to be deployed from augur-new. Install augur-new and test the schema creation with SQLAlchemy, and see if it at least creates a schema with all the data integrity protections we engineered into it.

### Objectives Accomplished:
1. #### Installation of augur_view:

2. ####
