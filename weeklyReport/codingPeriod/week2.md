## Progress till now:
- experimenting with the login-dev branch this week

- The auth flow for the moment is contained within a sqlite testing database setup that you can find here: https://github.com/augurlabs/augur_view/blob/login-dev/init.py

- Understood SQL Alchemy better and the advantages of SQL Alchemy over SQL or standard database model. https://medium.com/@shivikapriya730/what-is-sqlalchemy-749434ef6ee7

## TODO:
Steps might be:
- add import for sqlalchemy in the init.py file 
- figure out what kinds of parameters you need to use to connect to the postgresql database. 
- functions in User.py that will need to be updated. 
- Look up docs for this function: from flask_login import UserMixin ..
